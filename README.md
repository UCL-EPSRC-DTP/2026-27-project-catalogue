# UCL EPSRC DTP - 2025/26 project catalogue

This catalogue lists all the projects available for applicants to the UCL EPSRC DTP for 2025/26. [See the main website for details on how to apply.]( https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epsrc-doctoral-training/prospective-students/apply-ucl-epsrc-dtp-studentship)


## How to use the catalogue
Each project has its own summary page. All projects have a lead UCL department shown in their summary. Some projects also have a collaborating department if they are interdisciplinary projects. Each project also has a lead supervisor shown in their summary. All students recruited to UCL will also be supported by additional members of a supervisory team - for some projects this may be detailed in the summary, for other it will be finalised after a student begins. Project summaries also contain links to the lead department's UCL webpage, so you can read more about the department, and the lead supervisor's UCL profile page (for the majority of supervisors), so you can read more about the lead supervisor.

The UCL EPSRC DTP reserves the right to withdraw projects at any time, including after applications have been submitted, when necessary.

You can [browse the catalogue by research theme](#browse-all-projects-by-research-theme) - this will give you a list of all projects available within the research theme. Each research theme page has a link to the theme's summary page on the EPSRC website so that you can read more about the theme and the kind of research it covers. Clicking on a research theme name within a project summary will take you to a list of all projects with that research theme.

Or you can [browse the catalogue by lead department](#browse-all-projects-by-lead-department) - this will give you a list of all projects available within the department. Note that for interdisciplinary projects, they will only be listed within their lead department. Clicking on a department name within a project summary will take you to a list of all projects with that lead department.

You can also browse a list of all the [collaborative projects](collaborative/collaborative-projects.md). Collaborative projects are jointly funded by an external partner organisation, and involve time spent on placement at the partnerâ€™s premises.
