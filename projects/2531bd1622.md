### Project Summary:

Join an exciting, cross-disciplinary collaboration at UCL, uniting experts in Engineering and Brain Sciences to revolutionise how we model and study the human inner ear. This project aims to develop an advanced, microfluidic-enhanced human inner ear organoid (hIEO) system — a next-generation platform for understanding hearing loss and accelerating therapeutic discovery.
You will:
1.	Engineer microfluidic systems that precisely control morphogen gradients to enhance organoid reproducibility.
2.	Optimise organoid growth in defined hydrogels to improve structure, maturation, and function.
3.	Apply single-cell transcriptomics and advanced imaging to assess cell diversity and hair-cell functionality.
4.	Design a scalable “Inner Ear-on-a-Chip” to enable high-throughput drug screening and ototoxicity testing.
This ambitious, interdisciplinary project merges microfluidic engineering with stem-cell biology, integrating methods pioneered by Koehler and Hashino with cutting-edge chip technologies developed in the Szita Lab. Students will gain expertise in biomaterials, organoid culture, transcriptomics, and live-cell functional assays, using advanced hPSC reporter lines to explore drug and regenerative responses in real time.
Supervised by Professor Nicolas Szita, a leader in microfluidics and bioprocess engineering, and Professor Jonathan Gale, an internationally recognised expert in auditory cell biology and regeneration, you will benefit from world-class mentorship at the intersection of engineering, biology, and healthcare innovation.
Aligned with EPSRC’s Healthcare Technologies mission, this project delivers a disruptive, co-created platform that advances early diagnosis, drug discovery, and regenerative therapy development. It also contributes to EPSRC priority themes in Engineering Biology, Microsystems, and Vision, Hearing, and Other Senses, offering a unique opportunity to help shape the future of precision healthcare and sensory restoration.
