### Project Summary:

Why this research is important

Fuel cells and electrolysers are vital net-zero energy systems. However, their core components - membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) - pose a growing sustainability challenge. MEAs contain valuable platinum group metal catalysts and fluorinated polymer membranes, which are difficult to recycle and potentially harmful if discarded improperly. As deployment scales up, so does the volume of end-of-life MEAs, creating an urgent need for circular solutions that recover and reuse these critical materials.

This project will develop sustainable recycling processes that reduce environmental impact, improve resource security, and support the long-term viability of hydrogen technologies. It will also define scalable pathways for circular reuse of MEA components, supporting innovation in clean energy manufacturing.

Who you will be working with

You will join a collaborative research environment in UCL Chemical Engineering, working with Thomas Miller, Panagiota Angeli and Federico Galvanin. The project is part of a broader initiative focused on sustainable materials recovery. Your work will be based in the Electrochemical Innovation Lab (EIL) and Advanced Propulsion Lab (APL), which host state-of-the-art facilities for electrochemical testing, materials processing, and advanced characterisation.
________________________________________

What you will be doing

You will develop and optimise hydro/solvothermal processes to recover ionomers and catalysts from real-world MEAs. These recovered materials will be reintegrated into second-life fuel cells and electrolysers, which you will fabricate and test using standardised accelerated stress protocols. You will explore membrane stabilisation strategies and use advanced characterisation techniques - including electrochemical techniques and X-ray computed tomography - to assess performance and degradation.
