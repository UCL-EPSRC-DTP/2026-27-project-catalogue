### Project Summary:

Do you want to pioneer the mandatory safety standard that will protect cyclists for the next generation?

This PhD, in partnership with the Bicycle Association of the UK, is a high-impact engineering and policy challenge aimed at solving the single greatest threat to cyclist safety: the inability of vehicles to "see" them when line-of-sight is obstructed. With current vehicle safety sensors failing to mitigate risk, and the arrival of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) threatening to marginalise non-connected road users, this is a critical mission to ensure every cyclist's presence is broadcast directly to surrounding vehicles.

We are seeking a researcher to address two essential challenges simultaneously: 

Engineer the Solution: You will design and build a low-power, high-reliability Internet of Things (IoT) transmitter for bicycles. This involves bridging energy-efficient protocols (like ITS-BLE) with safety-critical V2X communication to create a proof-of-concept that guarantees sub-2-second, life-saving warnings, solving the critical power-constraint problem. Â  

Define the Mandate: You will produce the policy and economic justification needed to change UK law. Your analysis will demonstrate how the low-cost, decentralised VRU device eliminates the prohibitive expense of roadside infrastructure, providing the justification to compel manufacturers to fit V2X receivers in all new cars and HGVs, establishing V2X as the new, non-negotiable safety baseline.

The Ideal Candidate: We are looking for an exceptional, driven candidate who is likely a maker with a background in Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field, coupled with a deep interest in transport policy and real-world system change. If you are passionate about applying cutting-edge technology to achieve tangible social impact and influencing national legislation, this project offers a unique opportunity to shape the future of safer urban mobility.
