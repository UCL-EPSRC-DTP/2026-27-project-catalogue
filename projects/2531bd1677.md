### Project Summary:

Two-dimensional (2D) layered van der Waals materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides can host atomic-scale defects with remarkable quantum properties. These defects can emit single photons, localise spins, or create nanoscale electronic states, making them promising building blocks for future quantum technologies and are a strong focus of current condensed matter research.

In this experimental PhD, you will use ultrahigh-vacuum cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and complementary techniques to study the structure and quantum behaviour of individual defects in 2D materials. The work will link atomic structure to measurable optical, electronic, and spin characteristics, advancing understanding of how defects can be engineered to realise functional quantum devices.

You will gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art UHV and cryogenic instrumentation and collaborate with leading international partners who fabricate and characterise quantum-emitting defects. You will also work in close collaboration wiht theoreticians for calculating and understanding these defects. Short research visits to partner laboratories are anticipated.

This project is ideal for students interested in the intersection of condensed matter physics, surface science, and quantum technology, and offers an opportunity to contribute to the rapidly developing field of quantum materials research.
