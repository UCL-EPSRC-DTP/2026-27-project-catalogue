### Project Summary:

We invite applications for a fully-funded PhD project exploring innovative approaches to immune cell isolation and tissue engineering. Leukapheresis is the current standard for sourcing T-cells for CAR T-cell therapy, but it is costly, complex, and burdensome for patients. This project investigates whole blood filtration as a simplified, scalable alternative—potentially transforming access to cell therapies.
In parallel, the project will explore how immune and stromal cells captured from blood and bone marrow can be repurposed to enhance graft integration, vascularisation, and immune modulation in regenerative medicine.

You will work with cutting-edge imaging technologies developed at UCL to map cell-filter interactions and use high-throughput systems to simulate blood processing conditions. AI-based modelling will guide filter design and process optimisation.

Key research areas:

Evaluating T-cell yield, purity, and functionality from whole blood filters for CAR T-cell manufacturing.
Investigating blood-derived cell applications in tissue engineering and graft enhancement.

This interdisciplinary project builds on prior work in depth filtration and filter imaging (doi: 10.1002/btpr.3329; doi: 10.1007/s10853-021-06238-w), offering a unique opportunity to contribute to the future of cell therapy and regenerative medicine.

Ideal candidates will have a background in bioengineering, immunology, or bioprocessing, and a passion for translational research.
