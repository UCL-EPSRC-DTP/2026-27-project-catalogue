### Project Summary:

Join UCL’s Gender and Tech Lab, part of the Information Security Research Group, to investigate how digital technologies are misused in intimate partner violence (IPV) and stalking—often referred to as “technology-facilitated abuse” or “tech abuse.” Supported by a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship, this fully funded PhD offers you the freedom to shape a project around your own interests while contributing to an urgent area of research with real-world impact.

The remit is intentionally flexible but should align with the Lab’s focus on tech abuse, human–computer interaction (HCI), and usable security. Possible directions include: auditing apps, platforms, or devices to uncover misuse; designing and evaluating new technical interventions and safeguards; testing the safety and usability of existing technologies; developing prototypes that empower survivors; or applying computational methods such as machine learning or natural language processing to study patterns of gender-based violence. A second supervisor will be appointed to support the specific direction you choose.

We place strong value on both independence and collaboration. While you will define and lead your own research, you will also be able to contribute to ongoing lab projects, share ideas with peers, and work closely with NGOs, policymakers, and industry partners. Our goal is to equip you to publish at leading venues (e.g., CHI, SOUPS, USENIX) while ensuring your work directly informs policy, practice, and survivor-centred design.

Applicants should demonstrate a strong technical background in fields such as HCI, usable security, software analysis, or systems design, and an interest in combining technical methods with user-centred approaches.

Important: Before applying, you must contact Dr Leonie Maria Tanczer to discuss your fit and research ideas. Applications should include a short research proposal and must be submitted through the UELA central portal.
