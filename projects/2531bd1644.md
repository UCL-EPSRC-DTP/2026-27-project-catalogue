### Project Summary:

How do we grow more, waste less, and keep people safe while working in farms that are getting ever more complex? This project explores a new class of flying helpers: small drones with gentle robotic arms that can both touch plants and act without touching them, using sound waves to move tiny droplets or pollen. These “aerial manipulators” can slip into narrow spaces in vertical farms and orchards, reaching leaves and fruit that fixed machines or ground robots cannot. They will handle careful jobs such as precision pollination, gentle picking, targeted micro-sprays, quick inspections and minor fixes, as well as novel non-contact tasks like placing nutrients or beneficial microbes exactly where they are needed.

Why now? Climate change, labour shortages and rising costs are putting pressure on food production. Our aim is practical, scalable help for growers: faster, safer, and more consistent plant-level care that improves quality while reducing chemical use and waste.

The project is a collaboration between UCL and LAAS-CNRS, building on an open, shared platform so results can be reproduced and adopted widely. We will test in real greenhouses and vertical-farming facilities, working alongside growers to ensure the drones are safe around people and easy to use. By the end, we expect to demonstrate reliable flying assistants that can slot into existing workflows, boost yield and quality, and open the door to more sustainable, resilient food systems.
