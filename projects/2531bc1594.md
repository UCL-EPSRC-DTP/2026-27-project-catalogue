### Project Summary:

Natural gas, primarily methane, is increasingly used as a maritime fuel due to its lower CO₂ emissions. However, recent studies show that methane slip—unburnt fuel released during combustion—averages 4% and can reach up to 14%. Given methane’s global warming potential is ~80 times greater than CO₂ over 20 years, this leakage presents a serious climate risk. From 2026, ships docking at EU ports will face strict methane emission limits, with fines nearing ~$2 million per vessel, making effective mitigation technologies urgently necessary as further engine optimisation options narrow.

This project, based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in collaboration with Methanox Ltd and the UK Catalysis Hub, focuses on developing and evaluating methane oxidation catalysts. Methanox is advancing Pd/zeolite-based systems and monolith coatings, with a fast-track pipeline enabling transition from lab to pilot and ship trials within six months.
A central aim is to benchmark emission monitoring technologies. FTIR-CEMS is the current standard for real-time gas analysis, but its limited dynamic range (1–10,000 ppm) and reduced accuracy in complex exhaust mixtures (SO₂, NOₓ, hydrocarbons) hinder precise quantification. Accurate emissions data is essential for catalyst optimisation and regulatory compliance and hence a principal aim of this research will be to develop better measurement methods or techniques contributing towards developing improved techniques for marine measurement.

The student will assess FTIR-CEMS against advanced techniques such as portable GC-MS and chemiluminescence/IR spectroscopy, which offer ppb-level sensitivity and robust performance. Comparative studies will be conducted across lab reactors, land-based engines, and marine environments.

This project suits a chemistry graduate interested in small molecule detection, catalysis, and environmental science. It offers hands-on experience with analytical instrumentation, catalyst testing, and industrial collaboration, contributing to the development of next-generation emission control technologies for the maritime sector.
