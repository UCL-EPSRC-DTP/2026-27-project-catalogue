### Project Summary:

Shape the Future of Energy: optimal magnetic control of tokamaks for commercial fusion reactors

Nuclear fusion is often described as the holy grail of clean energy — a virtually limitless, environmentally friendly power source that could transform the global energy landscape. Yet today’s fusion reactors remain largely experimental, designed for short bursts of operation under the watchful eye of expert physicists. Their current control systems are sensitive to disturbances and heavily reliant on human intervention, making them unsuitable for the demands of commercial, round-the-clock energy production.
To realise the UK Government’s ambitious vision of integrating fusion energy into the national grid, it is necessary to develop cutting-edge, automated feedback control methodologies designed for the complex, interconnected, and dynamic nature of commercial fusion reactors.
Fusion systems present a unique challenge: they involve nonlinear, multi-physics processes that operate across varying timescales, complicated further by partial observability and uncertainty.  
The objectives of this project can include the definition of sensors placement methodologies to optimise monitoring and control goals to guarantee safe and reliable operation, the development of robust control architectures for specific tasks of the system, optimisation of hybrid learning-based, data-driven and model-based techniques, as well as resilience analysis.  
Through advanced in-silico approaches, you’ll explore how intelligent control can unlock safe, repeatable, and scalable fusion energy operations.
