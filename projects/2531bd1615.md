### Project Summary:

Currently, a significant proportion of surfactants in household consumer products derive from fossil-derived sources. Bio-surfactants present significant opportunities to green formulations, noting that techno-economic challenges limit their widespread deployment.The studentship will focus on bio-surfactant upgrading using continuous adsorption within a techno-economic framework. The project will combine large laboratory scale continuous adsorption, rigorous process modelling, and AI-enabled process optimisation within an encompassing techno-economic and life cycle assessment framework. This PhD project will impart a diverse range of transferable and highly sought skills, notably the process development interplay between representative experimental validation and in silico digitisation through modelling and optimisation.
