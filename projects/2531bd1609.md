### Project Summary:

Project Summary

This PhD project offers the opportunity to pioneer research at the intersection of analytical chemistry and cultural practices by investigating incense burning dynamics. You will study traditional resins including Boswellia sacra (frankincense) to understand how burning methods and environmental conditions influence chemical emissions and olfactory perception in churches, homes, and ritual spaces. The global incense industry's growth from £10.18 billion to a projected £18.67 billion by 2033 creates demand for evidence-based understanding of indoor air quality impacts and human exposure patterns.

Importance

This research addresses a significant knowledge gap in understanding how incense combustion produces volatile organic compounds and particulate matter under different environmental conditions. You will establish the first comprehensive framework linking chemical composition, environmental parameters, and sensory perception. Your findings will directly inform public health guidelines, indoor air quality management strategies, and cultural practice recommendations, positioning you at the forefront of environmental chemistry research with real-world applications.

What We Will Do
You will design and execute field studies in active incense-burning locations, measuring emissions and environmental parameters in real time. Using state-of-the-art environmental chambers, you will recreate these conditions for controlled experimentation. You will master GC-MS/GC-O techniques and particle analysis methods to characterize chemical transformations and link them to olfactory responses. The project culminates in developing a predictive model that you will validate against your field and laboratory data.

Who We Are Looking For

A candidate with analytical chemistry background, with experience in VOC/odour characterisation desirable, who seeks to apply their skills to unexplored research territory with immediate societal relevance.
