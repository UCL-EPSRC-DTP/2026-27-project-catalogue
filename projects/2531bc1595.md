### Project Summary:

This project offers the chance to work collaboratively between the London Centre for Nanotechnology (a cross-London alliance of UCL, Imperial College London and King’s College London) and Quantum Motion Technologies, one of the leading companies in the rapidly developing field of silicon-based quantum computing.  The company is aiming to exploit the existing global infrastructure for the engineering and production of silicon chips to scale up quantum computers to practically useful devices over the coming decade and recently installed the world’s first full-stack silicon-based quantum computer at the UK National Quantum Computing Centre.
The project would involve furthering the detailed understanding of the quantum behaviour of electrons in silicon quantum dots and incorporating it into models of the noise on the qubits of the quantum processor.  These models can then be taken up by the company’s Architectures team and used to understand the dynamics and error correction within the whole processor at a systems level.  This will involve mastering the various approaches to the theory of open quantum systems and identifying the one most appropriate for the effective description of the noise experienced by the electron.
Overall, the project provides a unique training opportunity combining cutting-edge semiconductor physics, open quantum systems and quantum error correction.
