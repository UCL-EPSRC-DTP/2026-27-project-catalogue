### Project Summary:

Why this research is important

Green hydrogen is essential for our net-zero future, but its enabling technologies depend on fragile global supply chains for critical materials like platinum and nickel. These networks are often controlled by a handful of actors, risking Europe's energy security and climate goals. This PhD project tackles that strategic challenge head-on, producing the vital evidence needed to design a secure, resilient, and “shock-proof” supply chain for the hydrogen economy.

Who you will be working with

You will be based at UCL’s Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction, the UK’s leading centre for this research. You will be supervised by world-leading experts Professor Dabo Guan and Dr. Jing Meng. Our group has strong links with government and international bodies like the World Bank, ensuring your work has a direct impact on industrial and policy strategy.

What you will be doing

This project blends data science with network and techno-economic analysis. You will:

- Map the global network of critical materials, from mine to electrolyzer.
- Use computational tools to identify chokepoints and hidden dependencies.
- "Stress-test" the system against simulated geopolitical and commercial shocks.
- Design strategies like recycling and strategic sourcing to build a more resilient future.

Who we are looking for

We seek a motivated candidate with a First or 2:1 degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., Engineering, Economics, Computer Science, Physics). Strong analytical and problem-solving skills are essential; programming experience (Python/R) is an advantage.

This fully-funded studentship covers fees and a tax-free stipend and is open to UK and international applicants.
