### Project Summary:

Why
Cities are increasingly layered with digital information, yet these datasets often remain fragmented and difficult to interpret in context. This project explores how Human-AI collaboration can transform Extended Reality (XR) technologies from passive visualisation tools into platforms for analysing and interpreting urban systems. By integrating AI with XR interfaces, the research aims to make urban data more legible, experiential, and actionable, supporting better decision-making in areas such as climate adaptation and urban resilience. The expected outcomes contribute to human-centred approaches for understanding and shaping urban systems, where data is not only seen, but felt, narrated, and experienced.
 
Who
As a transdisciplinary project, this research offers opportunities to work across fields, bridging technical innovation with societal impact. We welcome applicants from diverse backgrounds (e.g. architecture, computer science, urban studies, game design, geography). You should be proactive in exploring the intersection of technology and social science, and motivated to investigate how immersive tools can support inclusive, human-centred decision-making in cities.

What
You will develop and test a new framework for spatial reasoning using AI-enhanced XR interfaces. This involves design-led experimentation, participatory planning, and urban forecasting. Youâ€™ll prototype immersive toolkits that adapt to user intent, location, and sensory feedback, turning complex datasets into situated narratives. Ethical considerations, such as how AI interprets and prioritises spatial data, will be central to your work.

Where
You will be working within a transdisciplinary research group exploring the intersection of spatial computing, urban analytics, and immersive technologies. The project will be developed at UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, within the Connected Environments group, with expertise in digital twins, sensor networks, human-computer interaction, spatial AI, and urban informatics. You will also collaborate with local authorities in East London, engaging with real-world urban challenges and contributing to inclusive, data-informed decision-making that bridges technological innovation with societal needs.
