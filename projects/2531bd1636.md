### Project Summary:

Why this research is important
Photo-recharged batteries based on Zn metal batteries are considered as a system that
can simultaneously convert solar energy into electricity and store energy in the form of electrochemical energy with unmatched safety and ultra-low cost. However, the further application is limited by the stability and efficiency of the photocathode. This project will investigate the relationship between the photogenerated charge and the electrochemical reaction mechanism, to develop a high-performance aqueous Zn metal photo-recharged battery.
Who you will be working with
You will join an active research group specialising in energy materials and electrocatalysis. The team works closely with national and international collaborators, providing an excellent environment for interdisciplinary training and research. You will be supervised by experienced researchers with expertise in both electrode design and advanced characterisation.
What you will be doing
Your research will focus on designing and testing MoS2 based composites modified by different methods, and investigating how modification interactions control activity and stability. You will use a range of techniques, including electrochemical testing, electron microscopy, and in situ spectroscopic analysis. Alongside technical training, you will develop transferable skills in data analysis, problem-solving, and scientific communication, with opportunities to present your work at conferences and collaborate across disciplines.
Who we are looking for
We welcome applicants with backgrounds in chemistry, materials science, chemical engineering, or physical related disciplines. Prior experience in electrochemistry, nanomaterials, or applied physics is helpful but not required. Most importantly, we are looking for motivated students with a strong interest in clean energy research and a willingness to develop new skills.
