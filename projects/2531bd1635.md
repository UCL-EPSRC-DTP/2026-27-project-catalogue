### Project Summary:

We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to work on the Development of a
sustainable electrodes for solar-Driven Methanol Production, which aims to create a
revolutionary device that uses sunlight to transform atmospheric CO₂ into green
methanol—a sustainable liquid fuel.
This specific project will focus on designing and creating the core component where the
"magic" happens: a sophisticated, multi-layered electrode. Your research will involve
inventing new catalytic nanomaterials that can efficiently capture CO₂ from the air and then
convert it into methanol using both electrical and light energy. You will learn to synthesise
these advanced materials, use state-of-the-art techniques to characterise them, and
assemble them into functional electrodes using scalable printing methods.
This is a unique opportunity to gain expertise in the emerging fields of sustainable energy
and carbon capture & utilisation (CCU). You will work in a dynamic, international team
alongside leading scientists and have access to world-class facilities. If you are passionate
about developing tangible solutions for a sustainable future and have a background in
chemistry, materials science, chemical engineering, or a related discipline, we encourage you to apply.
