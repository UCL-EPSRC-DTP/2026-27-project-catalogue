### Project Summary:

The proposed research will investigate aspects of algebraic and analytic number theory, graphs theory, and algebraic combinatorics. Some computational methods may be involved. Potential directions include:

-	The arithmetic of elliptic curves and of Jacobians of higher genus curves, and the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. 
-	The analytic theory of L-functions and automorphic forms.
-	The arithmetic and cohomology of locally symmetric spaces.
-	The p-adic Langlands programme, especially the cohomology of arithmetic groups and their p-adic Banach space representations. 
-	Shimura varieties and the Andre-Oort conjecture.
-	The interface of combinatorics with analysis and in particular the positivity of Taylor series of inverse powers of various combinatorially defined polynomials.
-	Discrete geometry including Tverberg-type theorems and problems concerning lattice points.
-	Extremal and probabilistic problems in graphs and hypergraphs.
