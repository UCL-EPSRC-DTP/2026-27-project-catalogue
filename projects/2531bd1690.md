### Project Summary:

Very High Energy Electron (VHEE) radiotherapy is an exciting frontier in cancer treatment, offering a powerful combination of deep tissue penetration and sharp dose gradients through electron beams in the 50â€“250 MeV range. Unlike conventional electron therapy, VHEE enables precise targeting of deep-seated tumours while minimizing healthy tissue damage. Its compatibility with advanced delivery techniques, such as pencil beam scanning and utilization of the FLASH effect (providing sparing of normal healthy tissue), make it a strong candidate for next-generation radiotherapy.

As global interest in VHEE accelerates, one of the most pressing challenges is the absence of a standardized dosimetry framework. Accurate and reproducible dose measurement traceable to primary standards is essential for clinical safety, treatment planning, and quality assurance. However, current protocols are not optimized for the unique characteristics of VHEE beams.

This PhD project offers a unique opportunity to contribute to the foundational infrastructure of VHEE radiotherapy. The research will focus on developing and validating a robust dosimetry framework under reference conditions, aligned with national and international standards and dosimetry protocols. Central to the work are experimental measurements using large-area integrating detectors, including calorimeters and ionization chambers.

The candidate will work closely with scientists from the National Physical Laboratory and carry out systematic investigations using both in-house developed and commercial instrumentation, assessing their performance in VHEE environments. Measurements will be conducted at leading VHEE research facilities in the UK and Europe, providing access to cutting-edge technology and collaborative expertise. To complement the experimental work, Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations will be employed to support data analysis and refine measurement protocols.

This is a rare opportunity to be at the forefront of a rapidly evolving field, contributing to research that could shape the future of cancer treatment and pave the way for safe and effective clinical implementation of VHEE.
